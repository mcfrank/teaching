Code for modeling simple teaching games, corresponding to two projects:

+ Frank (2014), [Modeling the dynamics of classroom education using teaching games](http://langcog.stanford.edu/papers/F-cogsci2014.pdf)
+ Frank & Liu (in prep). 

`sims_oneteacher` - simulations correspond to the earlier (2014) paper. Note, there was an issue in the information gain derivation given in the SI for that proceedings paper that is corrected in the code and text of the later paper.

`sims_admin` - simulations correspond to the newer paper.
